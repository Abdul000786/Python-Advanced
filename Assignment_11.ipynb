    "1. The concept of a metaclass in Python is closely related to the concept of a class. In Python, a metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes. Metaclasses allow you to define rules, behaviors, and constraints that are applied to classes created from that metaclass.\n",

    "2. In other words, a metaclass is the class of a class. It controls the creation, initialization, and behavior of class objects. Metaclasses can be used to modify class creation, add additional methods or attributes to classes, enforce constraints on class definitions, or customize class behavior."
