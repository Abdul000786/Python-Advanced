    ". An assignment operator like += is not just for show; it can lead to faster results at runtime in certain scenarios. The += operator performs an in-place addition, which means it modifies the value of the variable directly instead of creating a new object. In situations where you need to perform repeated additions or concatenations to a mutable object like a list, using += can be more efficient than creating a new object each time."
