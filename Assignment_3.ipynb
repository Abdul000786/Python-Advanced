    "An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited from but not instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses, providing common attributes and methods that the subclasses can inherit and override. An abstract superclass may contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation in the superclass. Subclasses are responsible for implementing these abstract methods. In Python, abstract superclasses are typically created using the abc module and the ABC (Abstract Base Class) metaclass."

    "When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it creates a class-level attribute. This attribute is shared by all instances of the class, and its value can be accessed and modified by all instances. The assignment statement is executed once when the class is defined, and the resulting value becomes the value of the class-level attribute."

    "A class needs to manually call a superclass's __init__ method to ensure that the initialization code of the superclass is executed. When a subclass overrides the __init__ method, the superclass's __init__ method is not automatically called. By explicitly calling the superclass's __init__ method within the subclass's __init__ method using super().__init__(), the subclass can inherit the initialization behavior of the superclass and add its own custom initialization code."

    "To augment an inherited method instead of completely replacing it, you can override the method in the subclass and call the superclass's method within the overridden method using super(). This allows you to add additional behavior to the method while still leveraging the existing functionality from the superclass."

    "The local scope of a class and a function in Python is different.\n",

Variables defined in a class can be accessed by instances of the class using the self keyword, while variables defined in a function can only be accessed within the function's scope. Additionally, variables defined in a class are typically instance attributes, while variables defined in a function are local variables."
