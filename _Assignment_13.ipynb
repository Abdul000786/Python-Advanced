    " 1. Yes, you can create a program or function that employs both positive and negative indexing in Python. Positive indexing starts from 0 for the first element, while negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. There is no specific repercussion if you use both positive and negative indexing. It depends on your use case and the specific requirements of your program. However, mixing positive and negative indexing can make the code less readable and harder to understand. It is generally recommended to use either positive or negative indexing consistently to maintain code clarity.   "

    "The distinctions between indexing and slicing in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Indexing: Indexing is used to access individual elements of a list or any sequence-like object. It allows you to retrieve a specific element by specifying its index position. Indexing is done using square brackets [] and accepts a single integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slicing: Slicing is used to extract a contiguous portion of a list or any sequence-like object. It allows you to create a new list containing a subset of the original elements by specifying the start, stop, and step parameters. Slicing is done using square brackets [] with colon : notation."

Instead, it automatically adjusts the index to the nearest valid value. If the index is too large, it is reduced to the index of the last element in the list. If the index is too small, it is increased to the index of the first element in the list."

    " If you pass a list to a function and want the function to be able to change the values of the list (i.e., mutate the list), you should avoid reassigning the entire list to a new object. This is because reassigning the list inside the function will create a new local reference, which will not affect the original list outside the function.\n",
    " \n",
    " To change the values of the list inside the function, you can modify the list in-place by using methods or operations that mutate the list object directly. For example, you can use methods like append(), extend(), or index assignment (my_list[index] = value) to modify the list."

    "In Python, an unbalanced matrix refers to a matrix (a two-dimensional array) where the rows have different lengths. Unlike a balanced matrix, where all rows have the same number of elements, an unbalanced matrix can have rows with varying lengths. This can occur when representing irregular or sparse data structures where each row may have a different number of elements.\n",

With list comprehension or a loop, you can iterate over the required number of rows and columns and assign values to each element programmatically.\n",

    "Creating arbitrarily large matrices using list comprehension or loops has the benefit of being flexible and scalable. It allows you to generate matrices of any desired size without the need for manual assignment of each element. Additionally, list comprehension offers a concise and efficient way to construct lists based on specific patterns or conditions, making it well-suited for matrix creation."
